# accordion-1-project
This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial which covered how to create an FAQ accordion. Whilst I will not include a direct URL to the video, the name of the YouTube channel is 'Developer Empire', the video title is 'FAQ accordion using HTML, CSS and JavaScript' and the publish date of the video was 13 Feb 2021. The font-family, background-colour  and questions have all been borrowed from the YouTube video. The answers are different from those provided in the video and, if copied from somewhere else, are indicated using asterisks. The JavaScript is my own original work as well as a lot of the CSS. This project demonstrates my knowledge of using JavaScript to toggle specific classes depending on when the end user clicks something.
