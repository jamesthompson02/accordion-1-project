                        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
                        Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
                        A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, 
                        client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. **This text was copied from Wikipedia**.

                        Learning basic HTML+CSS doesnâ€™t take long, but learning to use them well does take some time. 
                        You can quickly grasp their basic tags and labels in about one or two hours.
                        But if you want to learn advanced HTML and CSS animations, then it will take more time. **This text was copied from UXPlanet**.

                        JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
                        Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
                        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. **This text was copied from Wikipedia**.

                        Aspiring front end web developers will not only want to be familiar with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They will also want to have a strong 
                        knowledge of how to use various frameworks and libraries for both CSS and JavaScript, such as Tailwind and Bootstrap for CSS and React for JavaScript. 
                        Additionally, they will want to be competent in version control using something like Git (and GitHub for collaborating with other developers).
                        They will also want to develop a strong understanding of SEO and how to boost SEO for websites using, for example, semantic HTML.
